# Music bot created for friends
## After groovy and rythm got banned by youtube the study server with my friends ran out of a bot that plays music so we created this bot to solve that :)

#

## In addition to the `discord.py` library, this bot uses the youtube downloader library `youtube_dl` accompanied by the FFMPEG tool, and allows users to play music on a voice channel, create a playlist, pause and resume the music as much as they want.

#
## Add the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=888305709639405579&permissions=0&scope=bot)

#

## How to setup the bot and test in your NASA PC
1. Set the token in a `.env` file

```bash
TOKEN=<you-discord-token>
```

2. Run docker container

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

# Enjoy!
